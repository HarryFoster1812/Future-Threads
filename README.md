During Development to generate content, but not during runtime

Describe the problem you identified that could exist in the year 2080. (Max 300 words)

Our project identified the problem of a lack of information about human development over time. With many different sources giving many different events that could happen to humans over time.
Another challenge is a lack of awareness over the balance of power of a government over time, and how difficult it can be to keep stability

Describe your proposed solution to that problem. (Max 300 words)

FutureThreads presents the user with a small selection of decisions and policies each year to select from. and from there deciding what events could happen to humans.
These events and the decisions affect the balance of power, trust in the government and nature, where if not managed correctly would end the game for the player.
This brings to the players direct vision the effects of major policies, not just on their target but also public trust and many other side effects.
It also shows them how much politicians have to balance over time

Give a brief summary of your code. (Max 300 words)

Our code is seperated into a distinct frontend and a backend, with the frontend using react, and the backend using express
The backend selects what events and choices the user is presented with, and the frontend manages displaying this content in an accessible fashion
The backend stores the events and choices in 2 JSON files, allowing for easy adding of data without needing a live database instance, and also allowing for easy pipelining with AI tools like gemini. During the hackathon we manually queried and reviewed gemini, but it was a planned feature to dynamically generate data using its content.
